The purpose of this project was to create a page where the user's basic knowledge of Javascript Essientals were tested via five multiple-choice questions. The user will first see instructions to the quiz as well as a view high scores button that is only accessible outside of the quiz-duration. Additionally, the user is presented with a Start button. 

Clicking the start button will commence the quiz as well as the timer. If the user inputs the correct answer, the timer will be unadjusted. However, if the user submits the wrong answer, the timer will be penalized by a deduction of four seconds. This is the case for each of the five questions.

Upon reaching the end of the quiz, the user is asked to input their initials to log their score.
